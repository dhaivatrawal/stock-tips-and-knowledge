Participants of commodity market:
Speculators:
Speculators and hedgers are the drivers of commodity market. These traders constantly analyze the prices of commodities and forecast the future price movement. For example, if they predict the prices to move higher, they buy commodity futures contract and if the prices seem to move higher, they sell the contracts at a price higher than the price at which they bought. If they feel that the prices would move down, they sell the contracts and then buy them again at an even lower price. In both the cases, they tend to make profits.

Hedgers:
Producers, manufacturers, etc. usually hedge their risk by using commodity futures market. Let us take an example to understand this concept. There is a wheat farmer and if there is fluctuation of prices during harvest and if price falls, farmer would face loss. To hedge this risk, the farmer enters into a futures contract. When there is fall in price in the local market, the farmer can compensate this loss by making gains in the futures market. In case there is increase in price during harvest, the farmer would face loss in the futures market but he can compensate this loss by selling it at a higher price in the local market.

What benefits does one get by trading in commodities?
Transparency in trading transactions:
As commodity trading happens over the exchange, there is no manipulation of prices neither by buyers or sellers. The buyer quotes a price and in the same way a seller quotes a price and if there is a match between the two, the order gets executed. Price discovery of commodities is possible without any manipulation and this is the major advantage of using advanced online trading platforms. Lower margins in commodity futures encourage small trades to use this segment to hedge their risk and get higher leverage.
